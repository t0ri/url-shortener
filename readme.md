# URL Shortener

> _Job hunting makes me **miss** being able to code as frequently as I could in college._ :sweat:

> _I saw [this tutorial](https://dev.to/brandonkylebailey/want-recruiters-attention-build-this-project-in-5-minutes-to-your-portfolio-1l6h?utm_source=digest_mailer&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=digest_email) by [@brandon-kyle-bailey

## 

The project took about **an hour** to rewrite with my own style, formatting, and comments.

Users can input a URL they wish to shorten and if they have a preferred slug for that URL.

When visiting `localhost:PORT/url/SLUG`, the browser will redirect to the URL associated with that slug.

## Stretch Goals
- Connect a MongoDB Atlas Database to app
- Host app online for Github Repo visitors to demo :sweat_smile:
